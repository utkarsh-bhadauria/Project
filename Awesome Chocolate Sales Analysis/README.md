- The quarterly chocolate sales trend experienced an abrupt spike in quarter 4 which is unsurprising as this period comprises several festivals. 
- There has been a notable shift in sales during the months of October and December. In February we observed a sudden decline in sales, which can be attributed to the conclusion of the festival season. However, sales remained relatively steady during March and April and there is a spike in the month of December with 28.9%.
